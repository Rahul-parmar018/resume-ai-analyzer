PROMPT: Create a Flutter web app that is a 100% pixel-perfect replica of the Django website.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Copy ALL assets: images from resumes/static/img/ to Flutter assets/images/, videos to assets/videos/
2. Extract ALL CSS values: colors, spacing, typography, shadows, border-radius from marketing.css
3. Replicate EVERY page: home.html, score_checker.html, review_resume.html, finder_list.html, finder_detail.html
4. Match ALL animations: scroll-in effects, 3D card hovers, floating background elements, confetti, progress animations
5. Port ALL JavaScript: file upload, API calls, form validation, dynamic content, modals
6. Exact design match: same layouts, same colors (#0b0c10 bg, #16a34a brand, #7c3aed accent), same fonts (Inter), same spacing
7. All features working: score checker, resume review, candidate finder, CSV export, file upload

MANDATORY: 100% visual match, 100% functional match, 100% asset match. No differences allowed.

2. Extract all CSS values and create Flutter theme
3. Copy all images/videos to Flutter assets
4. Create Flutter widgets matching each Django component exactly
5. Implement all animations and interactions
6. Port all JavaScript functionality
